## How to run the product

_This section needs to be edited to reflect how the user can interact with thefeature released in your project_

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, a file named 'island.jar' in the 'island' directory, and and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product can take two - four arguments. The first argument is name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary. The second is the type of mesh you want (enter "GR" for a grid and "IR" for an irregular mesh). If you choose a grid mesh, you do not need enter anymore arguments. If you choose an irregular mesh, you may enter the values (as integers) for the number of points generates and the lloyd relaxation level as arguments 3 and 4.

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator

	* examples for generating a mesh:
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh GR 
	* (this will produce a grid mesh)
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh IR
	* (this will produce an irregular mesh with the default values of 150 and 5 for points and relaxation)
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh IR 500
	* (this will produce an irregular mesh with 500 points and a default value of 5 for relaxation)
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh IR 300 8
	* (this will produce an irregular mesh with 300 points and 8 relaxation levels)

mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh

```

### Island

To generate an island using an existing mesh, go the the `island` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product can take 2 arguments: the first is the file containing the mesh and the second is the name of the file to store the island mesh.

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd island 
mosser@azrael island % java -jar island.jar -i ../generator/sample.mesh -o lagoon.mesh --mode lagoon
mossers@azrael island % ls -lh lagoon.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 keiralaskoski  staff   167K Mar 14 00:09 lagoon.mesh


```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product can take 2-3 arguments: the first is the file containing the mesh, the second is the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image), and the third is "-X" which tells the visualizer to output the mesh's debug mode (the third argument is optional, don't enter it if you would like to see the mesh's normal mode).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer 
	*examples for visualizing a mesh:
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg
	* (this will output a mesh in normal mode)
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X
	* (this will output a mesh in debug mode)
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../island/lagoon.mesh sample.svg 
	* (this will output an island mesh)
	
... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Backlog

### Definition of Done

The program must compile and install successfully in maven with the feature implemented and when run, produce give the desired output in generator and visualizer for multiple test cases.
